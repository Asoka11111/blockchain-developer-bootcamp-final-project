Final Project for Consensys Academy's Blockchain Developer Bootcamp


I am currently entertaining two ideas:

1. An app that you do something similar to the Domino's Eazy Order button, but directly from ETH to payment
  * Customer visits the ETHzy Order button site with the current price for an order + conversion fees denominated in ETH
  * Customer registers for the site and provides an ETH address with his account
  * Customer is redirected to home page
  * Customer clicks on pizza button
  * Customer receives pizza after order is processed and delivered

2. Something to do with flash loan exploits
